# scripts
Personal collection of useful linux scripts\
In this repository are stored my personal scripts used everyday in my Fedora KDE system.
Every script has two variants based on the output launguage: 
- English 
- Italian 

## Running a script 
To run a script it might be necessary to make the script executable to do this, on your terminal paste the following command:
```bash
chmod +x <script_name.sh> 
```
Replace with your desired script. 
## Warning! 
Some scripts require manual configuration to work properly (or work at all) open the file and read before trying to launch it!
